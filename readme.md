## "Gratitude and Growth: My Zomato Clone Journey"

Building a Zomato clone was an incredibly challenging yet immensely rewarding experience. Throughout the course of this project, I embarked on a journey of continuous learning and growth as a web developer. The complexity of replicating Zomato's user interface demanded a deep dive into HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles. It pushed me to explore advanced CSS techniques, master the interactive layout systems, and understand the importance of mobile-first development. It was a true test of my problem-solving skills, as I encountered numerous hurdles while striving for pixel-perfect precision.

Moreover, collaboration played a pivotal role in this endeavor. Working alongside with `four dedicated team members` not only divided the workload but also fostered a sense of unity and shared purpose. Synergy emerged as we harnessed each other's strengths and compensated for weaknesses, making our collective progress greater than the sum of our individual efforts. The respect and empathy we developed for one another transformed this project into an inspiring collaborative experience.

## This project is majorly focused on cloning the UI of Zomato using HTML and CSS. JavaScript click event is also used at some places to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface. The website allows users to find restaurants, browse menus, and read reviews.
